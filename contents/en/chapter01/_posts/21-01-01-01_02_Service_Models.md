Cloud computing services are typically categorized into three primary service models, each offering different levels of control, flexibility, and management responsibility. Understanding these models is crucial for selecting the right cloud strategy for your organization's needs.

## The Cloud Service Stack

The cloud service models can be visualized as a stack, where each layer builds upon the previous one:

```

│        Software as a Service        │  ← SaaS
│              (SaaS)                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│       Platform as a Service         │  ← PaaS
│              (PaaS)                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤

│        Physical Infrastructure      │  ← On-Premises
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

### Definition
IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It offers the most basic cloud service model, providing virtual machines, storage, networks, and operating systems on a pay-as-you-go basis.

### Key Components
#### Compute Resources
- **Virtual Machines**: Scalable compute instances
- **Container Services**: Docker and Kubernetes support
- **Bare Metal Servers**: Dedicated physical servers
- **Serverless Computing**: Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)

#### Storage Services
- **Block Storage**: High-performance storage for databases
- **Object Storage**: Scalable storage for files and backups
- **File Storage**: Network-attached storage (NAS)
- **Archive Storage**: Long-term, low-cost storage

#### Networking
- **Virtual Networks**: Software-defined networking
- **Load Balancers**: Traffic distribution
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDN)**: Global content distribution
- **VPN Gateways**: Secure connectivity

  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.0"
  }
}

// 2. Create server.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello Cloud Computing!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});

// 3. Deploy to Heroku
// git init
// git add .
// git commit -m "Initial commit"
// heroku create my-cloud-app
// git push heroku main
```
