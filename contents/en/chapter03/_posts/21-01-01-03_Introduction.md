This chapter focuses on hands-on MapReduce programming, covering practical implementation techniques, common programming patterns, and real-world examples. You'll learn how to write efficient MapReduce jobs using Java, Python, and other languages, along with debugging and optimization strategies.

## Learning Objectives

- Write MapReduce programs in Java and Python
- Implement common MapReduce patterns (word count, join, aggregation)
- Use Hadoop Streaming for non-Java languages
- Debug and optimize MapReduce jobs
- Handle complex data types and custom serialization
- Implement advanced MapReduce algorithms

## Topics Covered

1. **Basic MapReduce Programming**
   - Setting up development environment
   - Writing your first MapReduce job
   - Input and output formats

2. **Advanced Programming Patterns**
   - Secondary sorting
   - Map-side joins
   - Reduce-side joins
   - Chaining MapReduce jobs

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Combiner functions
   - Custom partitioners
   - Memory management
   - I/O optimization

4. **Real-world Examples**
   - Log analysis
   - Data cleaning and transformation
   - Graph algorithms
   - Machine learning preprocessing
