This chapter explores the complete Hadoop ecosystem, focusing on YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) as the resource management layer, along with HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and various tools that make up the Hadoop platform.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Hadoop architecture and components
- Learn YARN resource management concepts
- Explore HDFS distributed storage system
- Discover Hadoop ecosystem tools and frameworks
- Set up and configure Hadoop clusters
- Monitor and manage Hadoop applications

## Key Components

1. **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**
   - Architecture and design principles
   - NameNode and DataNode roles
   - Data replication and fault tolerance
   - HDFS commands and operations

2. **YARN Resource Management**
   - ResourceManager and NodeManager
   - Application lifecycle management
   - Container-based execution
   - Scheduling policies and queues

3. **Hadoop Ecosystem Tools**
   - Hive (SQL on Hadoop)
   - Pig (Data flow scripting)
   - HBase (NoSQL database)
   - Sqoop (Data import/export)
   - Flume (Log collection)
   - Oozie (Workflow management)
