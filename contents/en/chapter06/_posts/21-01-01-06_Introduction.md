This chapter moves beyond the core Spark engine to explore the powerful libraries built on top of it: Spark SQL for structured data, Spark Streaming for real-time processing, and MLlib for machine learning.

## Learning Objectives

- **Spark SQL**: Query structured data using SQL and DataFrames
- **Spark Streaming**: Process real-time data streams with fault tolerance
- **MLlib**: Build and deploy scalable machine learning models
- **GraphX**: (Overview) Analyze graph-structured data

## The Unified Engine

The true power of Spark lies in its unified stack. You can load data using Spark SQL, train a model using MLlib, and apply that model to a real-time stream using Spark Streaming—all within the same application.
