Welcome to Chapter 10: **Big Data Platforms and Processing**.

## Chapter Overview

Big Data has transformed how organizations collect, store, process, and analyze information. This chapter explores the fundamentals of big data, the platforms that enable big data processing, and the architectural patterns used to build scalable data systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Understand "big data"** and its characteristics (Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity)
- **Explain big data platforms** and their role in modern data ecosystems
- **Design big data architectures** including data pipelines and processing workflows
- **Differentiate between operational and analytical data**
- **Understand data governance** and quality concerns at scale
- **Work with big data processing models** (batch, streaming, real-time)

## Topics Covered

### 1. What is Big Data?
- Characteristics: Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity
- Sources of big data (IoT, social media, scientific instruments)
- Operational vs analytical data
- The value of data and data economy

### 2. Big Data Platforms
- Platform definition and characteristics
- Data as asset vs data as product
- Onion architecture for big data platforms
- Core services: ingestion, storage, processing, querying

### 3. Big Data Architectures
- Data-centric virtualized infrastructures
- Middleware platforms
- Big data services and applications
- Multi-cloud and hybrid deployments

### 4. Data Pipelines
- Data ingestion and ETL
- Data storage and management
- Data analysis and machine learning
- Reporting and visualization

### 5. Data Governance
- Data quality and lineage
- Multi-tenancy and SLAs
- Privacy and security concerns
- Compliance (GDPR, regulations)

### 6. Processing Models
- Batch processing
- Stream processing
- Real-time analytics
- Lambda and Kappa architectures

## Why Big Data Matters

Big Data is fundamental to modern applications:

- **AI and Machine Learning**: "No AI Without Data" - data is the fuel for ML models
- **Business Intelligence**: 360-degree customer analytics
- **IoT and Industry 4.0**: Real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance
- **Scientific Research**: Earth observation, healthcare, genomics
- **Smart Cities**: Sustainability and urban optimization

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this chapter, you should understand:

- Distributed systems concepts (from previous chapters)
- Cloud computing fundamentals
- Database basics
- Programming concepts (MapReduce, Spark from earlier chapters)

## Real-World Examples

Big data platforms power critical services:

- **Lyft**: 60 PB of queryable event data, 10 PB scanned daily
- **Sentinel (ESA)**: Petabytes of Earth observation data
- **NYC Taxi Data**: 112M+ rows of trip data
- **Network Monitoring**: 5M sensors generating 1.4B events/day
