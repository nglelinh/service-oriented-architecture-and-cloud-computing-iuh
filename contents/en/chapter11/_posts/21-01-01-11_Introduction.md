Welcome to Chapter 11: **Data Sourcing and Cleaning**.

## Chapter Overview

Data quality is critical for successful analytics and machine learning. This chapter covers the essential processes of acquiring data from various sources and preparing it for analysis through cleaning and transformation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Understand data sourcing** strategies and techniques
- **Identify data quality issues** and their impact
- **Apply data cleaning techniques** to improve data quality
- **Transform data** into suitable formats for analysis
- **Implement data validation** and quality checks
- **Design data preparation pipelines**

## Topics Covered

### 1. Data Sourcing
- Data acquisition strategies
- Internal vs external data sources
- APIs and web scraping
- Data integration challenges

### 2. Data Quality Issues
- Missing data
- Inconsistent formats
- Duplicate records
- Outliers and anomalies
- Data type mismatches

### 3. Data Cleaning Techniques
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Standardizing formats
- Correcting errors
- Dealing with outliers

### 4. Data Transformation
- Normalization and scaling
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature engineering
- Data aggregation

### 5. Data Validation

- Data profiling
- Quality metrics

## Why Data Cleaning Matters

**"Garbage in, garbage out"** - Poor data quality leads to:

- **Inaccurate insights**: Wrong decisions based on bad data
- **Failed ML models**: Models trained on dirty data perform poorly
- **Wasted resources**: Time spent fixing issues downstream
- **Lost opportunities**: Missing valuable patterns in noisy data

**Industry estimate**: Data scientists spend 60-80% of their time on data preparation!

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this chapter, you should understand:

- Basic statistics and data analysis
- Programming (Python/SQL)
- Database concepts
- Data pipeline fundamentals from Chapter 10

## Real-World Impact

Clean data is essential for:

- **Healthcare**: Accurate patient records save lives
- **Finance**: Correct transaction data prevents fraud
- **E-commerce**: Clean customer data improves recommendations
- **Manufacturing**: Quality sensor data enables predictive maintenance

Let's learn how to source and clean data effectively!
