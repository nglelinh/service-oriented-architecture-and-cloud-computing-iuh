This chapter compares the major public cloud providers—AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)—and explores their core service offerings.

- Compare the "Big 3" cloud providers in terms of global infrastructure and market share
- Map core services across providers (e.g., EC2 = VM, S3 = Blob Storage)
- Understand the pricing models and "Free Tier" offerings
- Analyze the strengths and use cases for each provider
