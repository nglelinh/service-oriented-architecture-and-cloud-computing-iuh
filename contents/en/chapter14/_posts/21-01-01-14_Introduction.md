This chapter introduces Infrastructure as Code (IaC), the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

## Learning Objectives

- Define Infrastructure as Code and its benefits (Version Control, Reproducibility)
- Differentiate between Imperative and Declarative approaches
- Learn the basics of Terraform (Providers, Resources, State)
- Understand Ansible for configuration management

## Automating the Cloud

Manual configuration ("ClickOps") is error-prone and unscalable. IaC allows developers to treat infrastructure as software—enabling code review, testing, and automated deployment of the entire data center stack.
